🔐 General Cybersecurity Terms

- Threat: A potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability to cause harm.
- Vulnerability: A weakness in a system that can be exploited.
- Exploit: Code or techniques used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
- Risk: The potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
- Asset: Anything valuable that needs protection (data, hardware, etc.).
- Patch: A software update that fixes vulnerabilities or bugs.
- Incident: An event that may compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of data.
- Malware: Malicious software designed to cause damage or unauthorized access.

🌐 Networking & Protocols

- IP Address: A unique identifier for a device on a network.
- DNS: Translates domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
- OSI Model: A framework with 7 layers that explain how data travels through a network.
- Firewall: A system that filters traffic and prevents unauthorized access.
- TCP vs UDP: TCP is reliable and ordered; UDP is faster but less reliable.
- VPN: A Virtual Private Network that encrypts internet traffic and hides your IP.
- MAC Address: A hardware identifier unique to each network device.
- DHCP: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- Packet: A small chunk of data transmitted over a network.
- LAN/WAN: Local and Wide Area Networks — types of networks based on size and scope.

🛠️ Tools & Platforms

- Nmap: A network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services.
- Wireshark: A tool for analyzing network traffic.
- SIEM: Security Information and Event Management — collects and analyzes security data.
- Kali Linux: A Linux distro with tools for penetration testing and ethical hacking.
- TryHackMe: A platform to learn and practice cybersecurity in virtual labs.
- Burp Suite: A tool for testing web application security.
